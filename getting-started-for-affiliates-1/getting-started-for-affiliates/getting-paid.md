# Getting Paid

Affiliate marketing is based on the revenue sharing model, where the merchant pays the affiliate for promoting products.&#x20;

#### How do I get paid for my promotions?

Before you start your promotions, you will need to set up your payment settings. You can do this by using the Payment Settings section in the affiliate dashboard.

You should also check the minimum payout, which is the amount of money you will have to earn (from your referrals) before being paid, and the payment terms that are the term periods for payment.&#x20;

It is advised that you ask the merchant about the details on the commission structure, minimum payouts, payment terms that have been set by them.

If your preferred mode of payment is unavailable, you can ask your merchant to set it up for you.
