# Using Your Dashboard

In affiliate marketing, the affiliate's job is to promote a merchant's product. An affiliate can promote a product on social media platforms, blogs, etc.&#x20;

#### Getting started with your referral link

After creating an affiliate account in a merchant's program, you will be provided with a referral link. This referral link will be used in promotions. You can share this referral link with your friends or followers.

The referral link is present in the Home tab of the affiliate dashboard.

#### What happens when you share the referral link?

When a customer purchases a product from the merchant's store using your referral link, you earn a commission on the sale.&#x20;

#### How do coupon codes work?

If a coupon code has been assigned to you by the merchant, you can also promote the coupon code. When a customer purchases a product from the merchant's store using your coupon code, you earn commissions on it.

The coupon code (if assigned by the merchant ) is present in the home tab of the affiliate dashboard.

#### How much commission will I earn?

The commission you earn will be decided by the merchant. You can view the current commission structure in the Home tab of the affiliate dashboard.&#x20;

**For example**: If the commission is set to 10%, then if a customer purchases a product of $100 using your referral link, you will earn $10 on that sale. &#x20;

#### How do I know that if a customer has purchased a product using my referral link or coupon code?

When a customer makes a purchase using your referral link or coupon code, the referral will show up in the summary section in the Home tab of the affiliate dashboard.&#x20;

The summary section shows you the number of referrals, the number of orders that have been placed using your referral, the conversion rate (from visits to purchases), the sale value, and your earnings.&#x20;
