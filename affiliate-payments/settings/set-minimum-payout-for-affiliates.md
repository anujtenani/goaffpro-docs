# Set Minimum Payout for Affiliates

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to set the minimum payout amount for affiliates.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The minimum payout amount allows you to set a minimum commission threshold that affiliates must reach before becoming eligible for payouts.&#x20;

For example, if the minimum payout amount is set to $50, then affiliates will have to earn a minimum of $50 in commissions before getting paid.
{% endhint %}

To set the minimum payout amount for affiliates, go to the **Payments** section in the **Settings** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.
