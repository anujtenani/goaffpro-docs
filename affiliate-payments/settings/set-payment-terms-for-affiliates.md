# Set Payment Terms for Affiliates

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to set up the payment terms for affiliates.

{% hint style="info" %}
The payment terms you set will be shown to affiliates in their dashboard, indicating how often you will make commission payments to them.&#x20;

For example, if you plan on paying affiliates monthly, you can set the payment terms to reflect that.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To set the payment terms for affiliates, go to the **Payments** section in the **Settings** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.

After this, click on **Save**.

For example, here we have selected the Net 30 payment term, which means that affiliates will have to be paid every 30 days.
