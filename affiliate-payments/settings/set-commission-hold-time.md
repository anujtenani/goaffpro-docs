# Set Commission Hold Time

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to set the commission hold time.

{% hint style="info" %}
The commission hold time feature allows you to set a holding period for the affiliate sales commission.  The hold time is generally set based on your store's refund/cancellation period to ensure that affiliates are paid for sales that have passed that period.

For example, if you set the hold time as 30 days, the commission of a sale will become payable to the affiliate only after 30 days have passed (from the date the sale was recorded).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To set the commission hold time, go to the **Payments** section in the **Settings** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.

Finally, the commission will become payable to the affiliate, only after the number of days that have been set in the commission hold time section.
