# Tax Implications for Affiliate Payments \[US]

### For merchants

Merchants must file [Form-1099-MISC](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc) with the IRS for all the affiliates registered as US taxpayers whose total payments in a financial year are more than $600. FORM-1099 is a physical form that needs to be obtained from the IRS and has to be filled and signed by hand.

To fill and submit Form-1099-MISC, you need to collect [Form W-9 ](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9)from the affiliates. Form W-9 is just a taxpayer identification form and is only used for collecting the affiliate tax details to fill the Form-1099-MISC later. The W-9 form itself is not required to be submitted to the IRS.

#### W-9 Form

To collect Form W-9 from affiliates, you can enable the W9 Form functionality from the Settings > Extras section. Once enabled, your affiliates can fill this form from within their dashboard in the Settings tab.

{% content-ref url="../../program-settings/extra-settings/w9-form-for-affiliates/" %}
[w9-form-for-affiliates](../../program-settings/extra-settings/w9-form-for-affiliates/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once they have filled out the form, a PDF gets generated and sent to you (and to the affiliates). The generated PDF can be downloaded from the Affiliate Files tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.

Merchants do not have to withhold tax/payments from the affiliates. They only have to ensure that for eligible affiliates, they collect the W-9 form for 1099-MISC form filing.
