## How do I pay via PayPal?

#### You have two ways to pay your affiliates with PayPal:

1. You can make the payment to the affiliate outside the app, directly over on PayPal. After that, mark the payment as paid within GoAffPro for record-keeping.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/create-payout-session/manually-pay-with-paypal.md" %}
[manually-pay-with-paypal.md](../affiliate-payments/create-payout-session/manually-pay-with-paypal.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

2. You can integrate PayPal Payouts from Settings > Integrations section. After that, you can make PayPal payments to affiliates from within the GoAffPro app.

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/setup-paypal-payouts/paypal-payouts-session.md" %}
[paypal-payouts-session.md](../affiliate-payments/setup-paypal-payouts/paypal-payouts-session.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## How do I pay affiliates from within GoAffPro?

#### You have two ways of making payments to affiliates from within the GoAffPro app:

1. You can integrate **PayPal payouts** with GoAffPro from the Settings > Integrations > PayPal Payouts section.

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/setup-paypal-payouts/" %}
[setup-paypal-payouts](../affiliate-payments/setup-paypal-payouts/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

This will allow you to pay affiliates using PayPal payouts from within the GoAffPro app.

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/mark-affiliate-payments-as-paid/pay-affiliates-using-paypal-payouts.md" %}
[pay-affiliates-using-paypal-payouts.md](../affiliate-payments/mark-affiliate-payments-as-paid/pay-affiliates-using-paypal-payouts.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

2. You can integrate **Tipalti payouts** with GoAffPro from the Settings > Integrations > Tipalti Payouts section.&#x20;

[pay-affiliates-using-tipalti.md](../program-settings/third-party-integrations/tipalti-integration/pay-affiliates-using-tipalti.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## How do I pay affiliates with store credits?

#### There are two types of store credits with which you can pay your affiliates, store gift cards and store discount coupons.&#x20;

1. For **store discount coupons**, you can pay your affiliates from within the GoAffPro app:

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/pay-with-store-discount-coupons/" %}
[pay-with-store-discount-coupons](../affiliate-payments/pay-with-store-discount-coupons/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

2. For **store gift cards**, you can issue the gift card outside the app (directly in your store) and mark the payment as paid within GoAffPro.&#x20;

## How do I deal with high transaction fees while paying affiliates?

We would recommend setting up a **minimum payout amount** for affiliates from Settings > Payments > Minimum Payout Amount section. It will allow you to set the minimum commission amount that your affiliates will be required to earn before getting paid.

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/settings/set-minimum-payout-for-affiliates.md" %}
[set-minimum-payout-for-affiliates.md](../affiliate-payments/settings/set-minimum-payout-for-affiliates.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**For example,** while you are paying an affiliate a $10 commission, if the payment service charges you a $2 transaction fee, that would significantly affect your margins.&#x20;

To tackle this, you can set up a minimum payout amount of say, $25, which would mean that you pay your affiliates only when they earn $25 in commissions. Since the transaction fee remains the same, paying the $25 commission to the affiliate will help you save both money and time.
