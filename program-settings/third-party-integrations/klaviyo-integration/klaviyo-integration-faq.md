## Why are my affiliate emails not syncing?

Affiliates not having verified their email address can cause the sync to fail. Make sure that your affiliates have verified their email address. To manually verify an affiliate's email address, follow this [guide](https://docs.goaffpro.com/how-tos/view-an-affiliates-profile/verify-an-affiliates-email-manually).

Klaviyo also does not accept improperly formatted emails, throwaway emails, emails that have unsubscribed or requested for deletion from the Klaviyo list. It can cause the sync to fail as well.
