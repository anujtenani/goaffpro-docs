# Setup Account Sync

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to register affiliates as store customers automatically.

{% hint style="info" %}
The account sync option automatically registers affiliates as store customers. Affiliates can then use their credentials to log into their customer account in your store.
{% endhint %}

To register affiliates as store customers automatically, go to the **Integrations** section of the **Settings** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.
