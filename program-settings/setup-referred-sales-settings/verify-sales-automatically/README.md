# Verify Sales Automatically

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to verify affiliate sales automatically.

{% hint style="info" %}
The verify automatically option automatically updates the sale status in the app, depending upon the order status in your store.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To verify affiliate sales automatically, go to the **General** section of the **Settings** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.

Now, enable the "**Verify Automatically**" option.

{% hint style="info" %}
If enabled, affiliate sales will be automatically verified and updated to reflect their current order status in your store.
{% endhint %}

You can also click on **Show table**, to see how the order status works:

| Order Status | Sale Status |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Pending      | New         |
| Processing   | Approved    |
| Paid         | Approved    |
| Refunded     | Rejected    |
| Cancelled    | Rejected    |

{% hint style="info" %}
For example:

* The order having a pending/incomplete payment will have the sale status of **New.**
* The order that has been paid for successfully by the customer will have the sale status of **Approved.**
* The order that has been refunded or cancelled will have the sale status of **Rejected**.
{% endhint %}

The sale status is displayed in the **Sales** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.
