### Include discounts

Enable the "**Include discounts**" option. You can adjust the commission calculation by the discount percentage, the discount amount, or a custom percentage. Also, you can create exceptions for coupon codes assigned to affiliates.

Additionally, you can enable the "**Also adjust for automatic store discounts**" option, which would adjust the commissions for automatic store discounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the "Include discounts" option is enabled, the commission will be calculated based on the discounted product price rather than the full order amount.

For example, if a customer spends $100 in the store using an affiliate's referral, applies a 10% discount, and the commission rate is 20%, the commission will be calculated on the discounted product price. In this case, the calculation would be: $100 - $10 = $90, and the affiliate's commission would be 20% of $90, which equals $18.

### Exclude VAT

Enable the "**Exclude VAT**" option. You also have the option to include the VAT in shipping. It is used to deduct the VAT from the product price before calculating the commission on the order.
