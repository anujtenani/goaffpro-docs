# Affiliate Membership Activation

### Here we take a look at the how affiliates get to choose their payment plan:

We have set up three payment plans for affiliates:

* Free $0
* Basic $10/month
* Premium $24/month

After the affiliate signs up for the program, the affiliate gets directed to the Activate membership page.

Here, affiliates can choose the plan they like. The fees, perks, and descriptions of the plans are displayed for the affiliate.&#x20;
