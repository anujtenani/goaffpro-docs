# Create an Affiliate Landing Page

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to create landing pages for your affiliates.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The affiliate pages feature enables affiliates to create custom landing pages, hosted on your store. These pages can be used by your affiliates in their promotions.&#x20;

Your affiliates can create customized landing pages that are tailored to their specific audience. They can add their unique content, images, and branding to these pages to make them more appealing to their followers.
