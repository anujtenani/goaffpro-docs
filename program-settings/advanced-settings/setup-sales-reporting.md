# Setup Sales Reporting

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to set up how sales are reported in the app.

To set up how sales are reported, go to the **Advanced** section of the **Settings** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.

Now, choose between order total or order subtotal.

The order subtotal refers to the order amount before factoring in the discounts, shipping, or taxes. On the other hand, the order total is the complete sum that includes any discounts, shipping, or taxes.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the order total is $100, with the product price being $90 and the shipping fee $10, then the order subtotal would be $90.&#x20;

In this sale, if a 10% discount is also applied to the product price, the order total would be $91 ($81 for the product price + $10 for shipping). In this case, the order subtotal would be $81.
