# Setup Cross Domain Tracking

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to set up cross domain tracking. It allows you to track sales across different domains.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**: If the store's URL is https://store.com and its landing page is https://landing.com \
\
Here, if you want to track customers being referred by affiliates to the landing page (https://landing.com) and finally placing the order on the store (https://store.com), you will  be using cross domain tracking for this.
{% endhint %}

To set up cross domain tracking, go to the **Advanced** section of the **Settings** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.

#### Embed third party tracking code on the landing page:

Here, go to the Third Party tracking section.
