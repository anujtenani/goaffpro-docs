# Enable Cart Based Tracking

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to enable cart-based tracking.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The cart based tracking feature adds tracking to the cart metadata, allowing cross window/browser tracking.&#x20;

For example, if a customer opens an affiliate's referral link in Instagram's internal browser but completes the checkout in their regular phone browser, cart based tracking attaches the referral code to the customer's cart to ensure that the referral cookie transitions when the checkout is completed in their regular phone browser.
{% endhint %}

To enable cart-based tracking, go to the **Advanced** section of the **Settings** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.
