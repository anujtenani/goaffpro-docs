# Third Party Tracking

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to track affiliate referrals even when you are using a third-party theme in your store.

To track affiliate referrals when you are using a third-party theme on your store, go to the **Advanced** section of the **Settings** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.
