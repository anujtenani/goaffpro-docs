# Enable Cost of Goods Deduction

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to enable the cost of goods deduction for calculating commissions.

{% hint style="info" %}
The cost of goods deduction option lets you deduct the cost of goods before calculating commissions for referral sales. It allows for a more accurate calculation of commissions by accounting for the cost of goods sold.

To enable the cost of goods deduction, go to the **Advanced** section in the **Settings** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.&#x20;

You will need to **activate** the cost of goods deduction on your store.

After this, the app automatically takes the costs from Shopify's cost of goods field and deducts them from the product price before calculating the commission.
