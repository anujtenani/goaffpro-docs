Now, select the affiliate who you want to credit for the referral sale if the customer comes to the store using two different affiliate links.

{% hint style="info" %}
The credit for the referral sale is set by default to the last affiliate whose referral link was used by the customer to visit the store.
{% endhint %}

With the "The first affiliate" option, the first affiliate whose referral link was used by the customer to visit the store will be credited with the sale.

* The first affiliate = Affiliate A will earn the commission for that sale.
* The first affiliate (strict mode) = No affiliate earns the commission for that sale. (since the customer came to the store directly)
