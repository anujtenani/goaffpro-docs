# Manager Account Accessibility

**GoAffPro** provides managers with their own portal for logging into their accounts.

To log into a manager account, go to the **URL:** [**https://app.goaffpro.com/master**](https://app.goaffpro.com/master) in your browser and enter your email address and password to log into your manager account.

If the manager account is provided with full access, then they will have the same control over the program as the merchant.

However, if any limits are put up by the merchant for the manager accounts, then managers will only be able to access the admin panel partially.

The sections that are kept inaccessible by the merchant for manager accounts will display the message "You do not have permission to view this page."
