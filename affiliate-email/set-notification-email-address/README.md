# Set Notification Email Address

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to set the notification email address. This is the email address from where the notification emails are sent.

{% hint style="info" %}
The from email option lets you set your own domain email address, for sending notification emails to affiliates. This adds your store's branding to the email communications sent to affiliates and helps create a professional impression.
{% endhint %}

To set the notification email address, go to the **Notifications** section in the **Settings** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.
