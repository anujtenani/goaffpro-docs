# Post Checkout Popup

The **Post Checkout Popup** option allows merchants to show a popup to their customers on the order confirmation page (thank you page). The popup promotes the affiliate program of the store.

You can **enable** it from the Post Checkout Popup tab.

### Simple Popup

The **Simple Popup** style provides you with additional customization options. In addition to setting the header image for the popup, you can also edit the title and content that will appear below the image in the popup. You can also customize the button on the popup, by changing its color, text and changing the URL that will open when the button is clicked.

### Advanced Popup

The **Advanced Popup** style gives you the most advanced customization options. Similar to the simple popup style, here you can set a header image and edit the title and content that will appear below the header image. There is also the option to change the button color, text, and the URL that will open when the button is clicked.&#x20;

The advanced popup will automatically register customers as affiliates in the program. It will also send them a welcome and invitation email. You can display the referral link and coupon code of the customer (registered now as an affiliate). You can also add social media sharing icons to the popup.

There are also advanced configuration options such as setting a signup bonus, showing the popup only for select products, or showing it if the order total is greater than a set amount.
