# Multi Level

The **Multi Level** tab can be used to set up the multi-level affiliate network for the program. In multi-level marketing, existing affiliates can recruit newer affiliates under them. Also, the parent affiliate will earn a network commission on the sales referred by their downlines.&#x20;

### Recruitment Mode

In the Recruitment Mode section, you can choose to set up either a **unilevel** or a **forced matrix** tree structure for your multi level affiliate network.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1597).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Recruitment Mode</p></figcaption></figure>

The **forced matrix** structure can be set to restrict the width and depth of the affiliate network.&#x20;

* The unilevel structure is the default configuration.
* You can switch to the forced matrix structure from the Recruitment Mode section and set your matrix width and depth (for example, a 3x5 matrix).
* To set a binary configuration, you can set the width as two and keep the depth option empty.
