# Commissions

**Commissions** are an important part of affiliate marketing, it is the money that affiliates earn when they share or promote your products and their followers purchase them from your store using the affiliate's referral. This earns the affiliate a commission on the sale.&#x20;

> Affiliate marketing works on the **merchant-affiliate partnership**, it is a win-win situation, since the sale of products increases, benefiting the merchant and the affiliate as he earns a small commission on the sale made.
