# Connections

**Connections** tab can be used to connect affiliates with customers. Whenever any connected customers make a purchase, the affiliate linked to them will get the commission for it. This connection is made using the customer's email address.

**To enable the Connections tab in the admin panel:**

In the **Settings** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel, go to the **Extras** section.

### Setup Recurring Commissions

In the Customer-Affiliate Connect section, you can enable the "**Automatically Connect affiliate to the customer they refer**" option to enable recurring commissions.

With that enabled, affiliates will earn commissions on all the future purchases of the customers, connected to them. You also have the options to set up connection validity based on new customers, time period and number of sales.&#x20;
