To refer **GoAffPro** and earn benefits from your referral, you will need to enroll in the program first. After your enrollment, you will be provided with a unique link, that you can then use for sharing and promoting the GoAffPro app.&#x20;

You can promote and share the link on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or even your own store's website. When another business or merchant uses your referral link to install the app, you earn points.&#x20;

These points can be redeemed for cash or premium upgrades to the app.
