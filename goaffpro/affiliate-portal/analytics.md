The **Analytics** tab can be used by affiliates to view advanced analytics of their referrals. These statistics can be used by them to refine and improve their performance.

### Analytics

Here, the affiliate can view data such as the browsers, operating system, or device used by visitors  (visiting the store using the affiliate's referral link). They can also view the landing page and the origin of these clicks.

In addition to this, affiliates can also view the number of visits, the number of orders, the conversion rate, and the commission they have earned.
