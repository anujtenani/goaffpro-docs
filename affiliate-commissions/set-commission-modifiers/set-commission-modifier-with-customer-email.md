After this, set the value.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:** Here we have selected the Customer email matches rule. So, if the email address of the customer (here: affiliate@email.com) who has placed the order, matches the value set in the matches field, the affiliate's commission will get adjusted by the commission rate set in the modifier.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Now, set the commission rate for the rule.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:** Since the customer (identified using the email address: affiliate@email.com) is using this affiliate's referral for placing repeated orders, we reward this affiliate with a higher commission rate by adjusting it by 20 percent.
{% endhint %}

Finally, click on **Add Modifier**.

![Click on Add Modifier](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2020-05-18 211551.png>)

The newly created commission modifier will appear in the Commission Modifier section of the Commissions tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
The commission modifier that we have set here as an example, will adjust the affiliate's commission by 20 percent whenever the customer with the email address affiliate@email.com makes a purchase using their referral.
{% endhint %}
