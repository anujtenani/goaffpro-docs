After this, set the commission rate.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:** Here we have selected the First time customer rule. So, if we set the commission rate for the commission modifier to 30%, then the affiliate who brings in a referral sale from a first time customer will get their commission rate adjusted by 30 percent.&#x20;

We do this to reward the affiliate, for bringing a new customer to our store and getting them to make a purchase.
{% endhint %}

Finally, click on **Add Modifier**.

The newly created commission modifier will appear in the Commission Modifier section of the Commissions tab.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The commission modifier that we have set here as an example, will adjust the affiliate's commission by 30% for referral sales by first-time customers.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
