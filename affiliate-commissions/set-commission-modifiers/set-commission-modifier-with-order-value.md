After this, set the value.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:** Here we have selected the Order value is >= rule. So, if you set the value in the matches field to $100, then the affiliate's commission will get adjusted by the commission rate that you set in the modifier when the order value is greater than or equal to $100.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Now, set the commission rate for the rule.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:** Since the order value is high we want to reward our affiliates with an extra commission, so we set it to 25 percent.
{% endhint %}

Finally, click on **Add Modifier**.

The newly created commission modifier will appear in the Commission Modifier section of the Commissions tab.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The commission modifier that we have set here as an example, will adjust the affiliate's commission by 25% for the referral order whose value is greater than or equal to $100.
