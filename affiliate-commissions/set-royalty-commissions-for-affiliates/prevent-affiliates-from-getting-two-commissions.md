# Prevent Affiliates from Getting Two Commissions

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to prevent affiliates from getting credited with two commissions for a sale. This can happen, if the affiliate who has a fixed commission setup, also refers the sale.

To prevent affiliates from getting credited with two commissions for a sale, go to the **Royalties (Fixed commissions)** section of the **Commissions** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.&#x20;

Here, you will be able to view the fixed commission that has been set up.

Now, in the All Sales section of the Sales tab, you will see two entries with the same order number.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Since there are two entries of the order, one will be with the regular commission and the other one will be with the fixed commission.&#x20;

Therefore, since the sale was referred by the affiliate who also has a fixed commission set up, the affiliate will get two commissions for the sale.

After this, go to the **Referral Commissions** section of the **Commissions** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.

Now, set up the product commission with the same product (as in the fixed commission), select the affiliate, and set the commission rate to zero.

Finally, you will see that the affiliate will now receive only one commission, which is the fixed commission.
