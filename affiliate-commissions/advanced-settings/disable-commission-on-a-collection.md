# Disable Commission on a Collection

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to disable commission on a collection.

> To prevent affiliates from earning commissions on a collection, you can set a zero percent collection commission on it. This will allow you to exclude certain collections from your program.

To disable commission on a collection, go to the **Referral Commissions** section in the **Commissions** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.\
