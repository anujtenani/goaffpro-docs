There are no limits to the number of affiliates that can join your program. GoAffPro offers unlimited affiliates in all its pricing plans (even on the free plan).

## Why is my custom affiliate portal not loading up?&#x20;

After you set the affiliate portal URL from the Look and Feel > Store Profile > Affiliate Portal section, select the "Subdomain of your shop" option and set the custom portal name.&#x20;

You must also create a new CNAME record in your domain provider's dashboard, using the Name, Value, and TTL that gets generated after you enter your custom portal name.&#x20;

|   Name  |         Value         |  TTL |
| :-----: | :-------------------: | :--: |
| example | partners.goaffpro.com | 3600 |

## How do I enroll affiliates/influencers in my program?

To recruit affiliates for your program, you need to promote your affiliate program on your store's social media channels (Facebook page, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) and add the link to the affiliate portal on your store's homepage (using a menu or footer link). Here

By spreading the word about your affiliate program and highlighting the benefits of becoming an affiliate in your program, you will start seeing people join it.&#x20;

## How are commissions calculated?&#x20;

By default, the commission is calculated on the order total. However, you can set the program to exclude shipping, taxes, and coupon discounts from the commission calculation. That way, the commission would only be calculated on the product price in the order.&#x20;

#### Why do we offer this option?

* It is an industry-standard practice of calculating commission.&#x20;
* It creates a more transparent affiliate program, your affiliates earn what they see (i.e. on your shop they see a $100 article and if you are offering a 10% commission on its sale, they are sure they'll get $10 for its referral).&#x20;
* Shipping/Taxes/Coupon discounts vary for different countries/states/locations. Therefore incorporating this would incur a great accounting overhead.&#x20;

## Can I customize the commission rates for specific affiliates?

You can use the **affiliate commissions** option from the Commissions > Referral Commissions section to set up different commissions for specific affiliates in your program.&#x20;

## How do I pay my affiliates?

#### You have two options to pay your affiliates:

1. You can pay the affiliate yourself (outside the app) and mark the payment as paid.&#x20;
2. You can integrate PayPal Payouts (from Settings > Integrations) and pay them from within the app. This method adds an extra 25 cents per transaction fee (from PayPal).  [https://developer.paypal.com/docs/payouts/reference/fees/](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/payouts/reference/fees/)

## Why I am seeing less commission getting calculated for my affiliates?

If the commission of affiliates is getting calculated less than the commission rate you have set, it can be due to the commission calculation settings that have been set in Settings > General > Sales.

#### Check out our guide on how to set up the commission calculation settings:

{% content-ref url="program-settings/setup-referred-sales-settings/set-commission-calculation-settings/" %}
[set-commission-calculation-settings](program-settings/setup-referred-sales-settings/set-commission-calculation-settings/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can also check the commission calculation adjustments in the order summary by going to Sales > All Sales > Click on an order number to open its order summary.

## How does referral link tracking work?

**Our app supports both referral link and coupon code tracking:**

* If the customer visits the store using an affiliate's referral link and makes a purchase. Our app will record that sale, and attribute it to the affiliate. The affiliate will be awarded a commission on that sale.
* If the customer uses the affiliate's coupon code to purchase in your store. Our app will record that sale and attribute it to the affiliate. The affiliate will be awarded a commission on such sales.

Note: if the customer uses both the affiliate's referral link and coupon code to make the purchase, the affiliate will still only get awarded a single commission on that sale.

## Why are referral sales not getting tracked on my store?

The issue of referral sales not getting tracked can arise if you are using a third-party checkout or a custom payment gateway in your store.&#x20;

We recommend that you connect with us at admin@goaffpro.com to get assistance regarding this.

## My test sales are not giving the intended results

It is recommended that you make the test sale in the private/incognito tab of your browser. That way, previously saved cookies will not affect the test. It also gives you the perspective of how a customer would be making a purchase when they visit your store for the first time using the affiliate's referral link.

If you still aren't getting the intended results as per your setup, you can connect with us at admin@goaffpro.com

## How do I add the link to my affiliate portal in the store?

#### You have two options:

1. You can add the link to your affiliate portal in either the header or the footer section of your store.&#x20;
2. You can create a custom page with your program details and link your affiliate portal to it.

Check out our guide on how to add the link to your affiliate portal in the store:

## What is the difference between referral and personal coupon codes?

<table><thead><tr><th>Referral Coupons</th><th>Personal Coupons</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>They are meant for the usage of customers.</td><td>They are meant for the usage of affiliates.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>When referral coupons are used by customers to make a purchase, the affiliate earns a commission on the sale.</td><td>When personal coupons are used by affiliates to make a purchase, they will not earn a commission on that sale.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Referral coupons are shared in affiliate promotions.</td><td>Personal coupons are used by affiliates to make purchases themselves.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
