# Access an Affiliate's Dashboard

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to access an affiliate's dashboard. When an affiliate logs into their account, the dashboard window opens up. You can access an affiliate's dashboard to view their referral statistics, set up payment modes, create landing pages, etc.

To access an affiliate's dashboard, go to the **All Affiliates** section in the **Affiliates** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.
