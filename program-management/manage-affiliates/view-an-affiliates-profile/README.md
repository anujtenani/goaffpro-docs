# View an Affiliate's Profile

GoAffPro provides you with the option to view an affiliate's profile. By opening up an affiliate's profile, you can approve or reject their account, set up commissions, create customer-affiliate connections, make changes to their profile, etc.

To view an affiliate's profile, go to the **All Affiliates** section in the **Affiliates** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.
