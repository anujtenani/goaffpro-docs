# Multi Level Marketing

**Multi-level marketing** also known as network marketing is a type of marketing strategy where existing affiliates of your program can recruit newer affiliates under them, and earn network commissions on the sales referred by their downline affiliates.&#x20;

In addition to the commission earned by the existing affiliate on referring sales directly, they also earn a percentage of the commission of their recruited affiliate's (downline) sale.&#x20;

### How does GoAffPro help you with setting up a multi-level affiliate network?

GoAffPro provides you with the option to set up a **multi-level affiliate network** for your program. With this feature, you can create a hierarchical referral system where the commission is distributed across multiple levels of affiliates.

This not only ensures that your top-performing affiliates get rewarded for their efforts but also motivates them to recruit more affiliates to join your program. By expanding your affiliate network, you can increase your brand's visibility, generate more leads, and ultimately boost your sales.

### How to set up a multi-level affiliate network with GoAffPro for your program?

To set up the multi-level affiliate network for your affiliate program, go to the **Multi Level** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.&#x20;

In the **Multi Level Marketing** section, you can enable the toggle. This will allow your affiliates to recruit newer affiliates (downline) under them.

#### Levels and Commissions <a href="#levels-and-commissions" id="levels-and-commissions"></a>

In the **Levels and Commissions** section, you set the number of levels and commissions for each level. The number of levels dictates how the commission will get distributed among the affiliate network.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3440).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Levels and Commissions</p></figcaption></figure>

You can click on Change. Select the number of levels and set the commission rate for each level. Finally, you can save it.&#x20;

**For example,** in the above network, partner 1 recruited partner 2, and partner 2 further recruited partner 3. If partner 3 refers the sale:

* Partner 3 earns the referral commission
* Partner 2 earns the level 1 commission (5%)
* Partner 1 earns the level 2 commission (3%)

That is: Partner 3 refers the sale and earns the referral commission. Partner 2 will earn the level 1 commission and Partner 1 will earn the level 2 commission.&#x20;

* **Show sponsor on the signup page:** You can enable this option to display the parent/sponsor name on the signup page.
* **Level commission calculation method:** Select the commission calculation method for the level commission. You can choose either the dynamic calculation method or the simple calculation method.

**The multi-level marketing feature in GoAffPro can be used to set up a unilevel, binary, or forced matrix network hierarchy for your program.**

* The unilevel structure is the default configuration.
* You can switch to the forced matrix structure from the Multi Level > Recruitment Mode section and set your matrix width and depth (for example, a 3x5 matrix).
* To set a binary configuration, you can set the width as two and keep the depth option empty.
