The target that has been set here has the following settings:

* Name: Target One
* Time Period: This month (Current Month)
* Applies on: Sale Commission
* Minimum Value:  ₹100 (this can vary according to your currency)
* Bonus: ₹50

This target will provide a ₹50 bonus to the affiliate after the affiliate earns ₹100 in sales commission. The target bonus will only apply to the sales commission earned in the current month.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For example: If the affiliate crosses the minimum value of ₹100 in sales commission in the current month. The affiliate will get a Rs.50 bonus.
