# Set Commission Booster for Affiliates

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to set a commission booster for affiliates.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The commission booster feature allows you to boost the commission of affiliates, when they hit a target. You can use this to set up a tiered commission structure in your program.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To set the commission booster for affiliates, go to the **Commission Booster** section in the **Targets** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.

Firstly, you have the option to set a name for the booster.

![Set a name for the booster](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2020-05-20 204641.png>)

Here, you can select the parameter the booster will apply to.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:** If you select the option "Number of orders" then your affiliates will have to cross a minimum number of orders (set in the Minimum Value field) to gain the commission boost.
{% endhint %}

You also have the option to select the time period for the booster.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:** If you select the option "Last 30 days" then affiliates will have to cross the minimum value of the parameter in the last 30 days to gain the commission boost.
{% endhint %}

![Set the time period](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2020-05-20 215730.png>)

After this, set the minimum value to be achieved by the affiliate to receive the commission boost.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:** If you set the minimum value to 5 and the booster has the "Number of orders" parameter and the "Last 30 days" set in the time period, then affiliates will have to get at least 5 referral orders within the last 30 days to get the commission boost.
{% endhint %}

![Set the minimum value](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2020-05-20 214830.png>)

Finally, set the boost that the affiliates will get when the minimum value of the parameter is crossed.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example**: The boost is given on the affiliate's original commission. So if the affiliate is set to receive a 10% commission on a $100 sale, and the boost percentage is set to 25%, the final commission rate will be 10% + (25% of 10%) = 12.5%
{% endhint %}

![Set the commission boost](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2020-05-20 215506.png>)

Now, click on **Save.**

![Click on Save](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2020-05-20 220103.png>)

The newly created commission booster will appear in the Commission Booster section of the Targets tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example:** The commission booster that has been set here, will provide a 25% boost on the 10% commission of affiliates, bringing their commission rate to 12.5% when they get at least 5 referral orders in the last 30 days.&#x20;

Note: The boosted commission rate will only apply to the sales that take place after the affiliate becomes eligible for the booster. It will not apply to the existing sales, that have already been recorded.&#x20;
