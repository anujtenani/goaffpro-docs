# Check the Commission Boost

### Finally, we will assign the orders to an affiliate in the app and check the commission boost:

#### Assign the sale to the affiliate

Click on **create a new sale manually**, in the **All Sales** section of the **Sales** tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.

Now, select the order number #1016 and the test affiliate. After this, click on **Assign Sale**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Repeat the process for the order number #1017.&#x20;

Finally, the orders will appear in the Sales tab.&#x20;

The sales commission for order #1016 is ₹100 (10% commission rate). This makes the affiliate eligible for the commission booster, as the affiliate has achieved the minimum value set for the commission booster (the minimum value is set as ₹100).

The commission on order #1017 is ₹125, for which the commission booster has been applied. The default commission of 10% has been boosted by 25% which makes it 12.5% (12.5% of ₹1000 = ₹125).

The order summary for the order #1017 shows us that a commission boost of ₹25 has been added to the commission of the affiliate.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The default commission of 10% has been boosted by 25% (by the commission booster) which has made it 12.5% (10% of ₹1000 + 25% of ₹100 = ₹125).
