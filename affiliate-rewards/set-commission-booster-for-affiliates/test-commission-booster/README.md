The commission booster that has been set here has the following settings:

* Name: Booster One
* Time Period: This month (Current Month)
* Applies on: Sale Commission
* Minimum Value:  ₹100 (this can vary according to your currency)
* Boost: 25%

This commission booster will provide a 25% boost to the existing commission rate of the affiliate after the affiliate earns ₹100 in sales commission. The booster will only apply to the sales commission earned in the current month.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For example: If the commission rate of the affiliate is set to 10% by default, then, if the affiliate crosses the minimum value of ₹100 in sales commission in the current month. The affiliate will get a 25% commission boost on his existing commission, that is, 25% of 10% = 12.5%.&#x20;
