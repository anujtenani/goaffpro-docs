# Create Test Product and Orders

### After setting up the commission booster in the GoAffPro app, we will now be creating a test product and test orders:

#### Create a test product

To create a test product, go to the **Products** section of the Shopify panel.&#x20;

Here, create a new product with the following values:

* Title: Product A
* Pricing: â‚¹1000
* Quantity: 2

#### Create test orders

To create the test orders, go to the **Orders** section of the Shopify panel.

Here, create two orders with Product A as the item, also create a customer for the order and mark the order as paid.

{% hint style="info" %}
For Example: Here, we have created two orders #1016 and #1017, both of which have product A as the item purchased.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
