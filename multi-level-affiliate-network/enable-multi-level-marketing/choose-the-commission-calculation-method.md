### Simple Commission Calculation Method

If you choose the simple commission calculation method, the commission is calculated as the **percentage of the order value**.&#x20;

You also have the option to apply the level commissions, even if the sale/referral commission is nil by enabling the **Apply Level Commission even when sale commission is nil** option.

**For Example:** Here, we have a multi-level affiliate network that uses the simple commission calculation method. The order value is $100, the referral commission rate is 10%, and the level 1 commission is 5%.

**If Partner B (downline affiliate) refers the sale:**

* Partner B will earn the referral commission of 10% = $10
* Partner A (parent affiliate) will earn 5% on the order value = $5

### Dynamic Commission Calculation Method

If you choose the dynamic commission calculation method, the commission is calculated as the **percentage of the sale commission**.&#x20;

**For Example:** Here, we have a multi-level affiliate network that uses the dynamic commission calculation method. The order value is $100, the referral commission rate is 10%, and the level 1 commission is 5%.

**If Partner B (downline affiliate) refers the sale:**

* Partner A (parent affiliate) will earn 5% on the sale/referral commission earned by the downline affiliate (which is $10) = $0.5
