# Setup Levels and Commissions

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to set up the levels and the commissions in the multi-level affiliate network.

{% hint style="info" %}
The levels and commissions option allows you to set up the network commission for each level in the network. The parent affiliate earns the network commission (based on their level) on the sales referred by their downline affiliates.
{% endhint %}

To set up the levels and commissions in the multi-level affiliate network, go to the **Multi Level** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.&#x20;
