# Setup Basic Popup

The **Basic Popup** is the popup style that allows you to set up a basic layout for the popup. You can add a header image, image link, and other popup configurations.&#x20;

To set up the basic popup, click on **Select & Customize**.&#x20;

The basic popup section consists of three sections for customizing the popup. By default when you enable the Post Checkout Popup feature, the basic popup will be activated.

#### There are three customizable sections available in the basic popup: <a href="#there-are-six-customization-options-available-in-the-advanced-popup-style" id="there-are-six-customization-options-available-in-the-advanced-popup-style"></a>

### Header Image

The **Header Image** option can be used to upload an image that will appear in the popup. You can choose the image from the GoAffPro gallery, or you can upload a header image of your choice.

To change the header image of the popup, click on **Delete**, and then click on **Browse** or **Choose file**, to upload a different header image. You also have the option to adjust the width and height of the header image.

To the right, in the popup preview, the image you select will appear as the header image of the popup. This will show you the look of the popup with the header image you have chosen.

### Image Click

You also have the option to edit the image URL, which will open up when the customer clicks on the image. This is meant to direct the customer to the affiliate portal page, allowing them to register in your program. There is also an option to select whether to open the URL in a new tab or the same tab.&#x20;

### Other Configuration

In the **Other Configuration** section, you can set additional options for the popup, such as closing the popup when the escape button is presse&#x64;**,** closing the popup when a background click is made, or displaying the popup only once per customer.&#x20;

There is also the option to embed the popup in the order confirmation page (instead of it appearing as a popup).
