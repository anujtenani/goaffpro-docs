# Shopify POS Support

**GoAffPro** is compatible with the Shopify Point of Sale (POS) system. If you are operating a POS counter, you can utilize any of the following options to make the POS system work with our app:

### Use Order Tags

* When creating the order via the POS system, ask the customer for the affiliate's referral code, name, or email address.
* After that, you can write any of these as the **order tag** while creating the customer's order in the POS system.&#x20;
* Our system will automatically pick up the order and assign it to the affiliate.&#x20;

### Use Order Notes

* When creating the order via the POS system, ask the customer for the affiliate's referral code.
* After that, add the affiliate's referral code in the order notes, while creating the customer's order in the POS system.
* Our system will automatically attribute the order to the affiliate.

### Use Customer-Affiliate Connect

* Before creating the order via the POS system, ask the customer for the affiliate's referral code, name, or email address.
* Use that to connect the customer's email address/account to the affiliate's account within our app.&#x20;
* After that, the order you create for the customer will automatically get attributed to the connected affiliate.&#x20;

**Here is the guide for creating a customer-affiliate connection in our app:**

{% endcontent-ref %}

### Assign Sale to Affiliate

* When creating the order via the POS system, you can ask the customer for the affiliate's referral code, name, or email address.
* After creating the order, you can open our app, go to the Sales > All Sales section, and click on **Create new sale manually**.
* Here, select the order number and the affiliate. Finally, click on Assign Order.

**Here is the guide for assigning the sale to the affiliate in our app:**

{% endcontent-ref %}

### Use Discount Codes

* When creating orders via the POS system, ask the customer if they have a discount code.
* After that, you can apply the discount code to the order.
* If the discount code belongs to an affiliate, the sale will automatically get attributed to them.

**Here is the guide for generating discount codes for affiliates automatically:**&#x20;
