To test affiliate tracking, you can follow these steps through the entire customer visit lifecycle. This involves clicking on the affiliate link, visiting the website, adding items to the cart, and completing the purchase.

### Create a new affiliate account

You can create the affiliate account from within the GoAffPro app, or use the signup page of your affiliate portal.

#### Create a new affiliate from the Affiliates tab

Go to the Affiliates > All Affiliates section and click on **Create New Affiliate**.

### Visit your store using the affiliate link

Open the **referral link** on your browser. The affiliate visit will now be tracked by GoAffPr&#x6F;**.**

To confirm that your visit is getting tracked, open the **Analytics** tab in your admin panel. In the visits table, you will see a unique visit recorded.

### Browse around your store

When you open your store using the affiliate's referral link, your visit will start getting tracked. You can navigate around the store, view different products, and add them to your cart.&#x20;

### Make a purchase and confirm the sale

Finally, add a product to your cart and purchase it. This sale would get recorded by GoAffPro and will be attributed to the affiliate, who will earn a commission on it.&#x20;

**To confirm that a referral sale was successfully made:**

* You will receive an email informing you that a new affiliate sale has been made.
* The affiliate will receive an email informing them, that a sale has been made using their referral.
* You will be able to view the referral sale recorded in the Sales > All Sales section.&#x20;
