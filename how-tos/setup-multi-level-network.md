<summary>Multi Level Commission Distribution Example</summary>

If you have an affiliate network with affiliates A, B, and C (where affiliate A recruited affiliate B and affiliate B recruited affiliate C)

**If Affiliate C refers the sale:**

* Affiliate C earns the referral commission.
* Affiliate B will earn level 1 commission.
* Affiliate A will earn level 2 commission.

**If Affiliate B refers the sale:**

* Affiliate B earns the referral commission.
* Affiliate A will earn level 1 commission.

**If Affiliate A refers the sale:**

* Affiliate A will earn the referral commission

#### Note:

* The parent of the affiliate (who refers the sale) will always earn the level 1 commission.
* The referral commission here is the commission that is set in the commissions tab (or can also be called direct commission)
