# Paying Affiliates

### **GoAffPro** provides you with two options to pay the affiliates in your program:

* Pay affiliates outside GoAffPro.
* Pay affiliates within GoAffPro.

### Pay affiliates outside GoAffPro

This is the process you will be using if you intend to pay affiliates using methods like bank transfer, debit card, etc. &#x20;

1\. Select the supported payment methods for affiliates from Settings > Payments.

![Settings > Payments > Supported Payment Methods](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2955).png>)

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/settings/setup-supported-payment-methods/" %}
[setup-supported-payment-methods](../affiliate-payments/settings/setup-supported-payment-methods/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Your affiliates will then select from the payment methods you choose to support and enter their payment details (they will be doing this from their account dashboards).
{% endhint %}

2\. View the pending payments to affiliates from the Payouts > Payments section.

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/view-pending-payouts/" %}
[view-pending-payouts](../affiliate-payments/view-pending-payouts/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

3\. After this, you can make the payment directly to the affiliate, outside the GoAffPro app.

{% hint style="info" %}
Making the payment to the affiliate (and its process) will depend upon the payment method that has been selected.
{% endhint %}

4\. Finally, you can [mark the payment as paid](../affiliate-payments/create-payout-session/) in the Payouts > Payments section.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/create-payout-session/" %}
[create-payout-session](../affiliate-payments/create-payout-session/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Pay affiliates within GoAffPro

To pay affiliates from within the GoAffPro app, you will have to integrate PayPal Payouts and use that to send money to affiliates.

1\. Select PayPal as the supported payment method from Settings > Payments section.

2\. Go to Settings > Integrations and set up PayPal Payouts.

![Settings > Integrations > PayPal Payouts](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-01-28 021749.png>)

{% content-ref url="../affiliate-payments/setup-paypal-payouts/" %}
[setup-paypal-payouts](../affiliate-payments/setup-paypal-payouts/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

3\. After this, you can go to the Payouts tab, create a payout session, and make the payment using PayPal Payouts integration.
