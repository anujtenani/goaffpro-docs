# Prevent Affiliate Fraud

### To prevent affiliate fraud and monitor misuse, we recommend the following:

* Enable the Detect Coupon Leaks feature.
* Enable the Dynamic Coupons feature.
* Enable Conversion Details for All Sales table.
* Use the Block IP/Origins option.
* Use the Block Google Ads option.

### Enable the Detect Coupon Leaks feature

Go to the Coupons > Detect Coupon Leaks section > Turn **ON** the toggle. It will notify you when coupons leak on coupon sites, allowing you to take appropriate action.

You can review the leaked coupons, view the associated affiliate, and take actions like [removing the coupon code](https://docs.goaffpro.com/how-tos/delete-coupon-from-goaffpro-app-code) or [blocking the affiliate account](https://docs.goaffpro.com/how-tos/approve-reject-an-affiliate-account/block-delete-an-affiliate-account).

### Enable the Dynamic Coupons option

Go to the Coupons > Dynamic Coupons section > Turn **ON** the toggle. When enabled, a new coupon code is automatically generated for each affiliate. The coupon code is automatically applied for customers when they visit the store through the affiliate's referral link.

The coupon code is valid for a limited time, after which it automatically refreshes. This helps prevent coupon leaks by ensuring that the codes are frequently changed.

### Enable Conversion Details for the All Sales table

Go to the Sales > All Sales section > Click on Settings > Select Conversion Details > Click on **Save**. The conversion details column will display the conversion summary of the sale. It will help detect traffic generated via unauthorized means like Google CPC ads and take appropriate action.

### Use the Blocked IP/Origins option

To block traffic from unapproved websites/domains, you can use the Blocked IP/Origins option from the Settings > Advanced section. Here, you can enter the URL of the website/domain from where you want to block commissions/tracking.

For example: To block the tracking of affiliate traffic from Facebook, you can add Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/) in the Blocked Origins/Domains section.

### **Use the Block Google Ads option**

To block referral sales made via Google ads, you can use the Block Google Ads option from the Settings > Advanced section. Here, you can set the app to reject sales made via Google ad clicks.&#x20;

Google ad clicks happen when an affiliate buys keywords for your store on Google ads, converting your organic customers into referrals. This means that when a customer searches for your store on Google, clicks on the affiliate's ad, and ends up on your site, it is considered a Google ad click.
