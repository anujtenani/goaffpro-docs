# Affiliate's Referral Code

An affiliate's referral link is different from an affiliate's referral code. A referral link directs the customer to the merchant's store and the customer's visit is then tracked.&#x20;

In the case of a referral code, it is the unique code present at the end of an affiliate's referral link. It has to be copy-pasted into the referral code input field at the shopping cart page on the store.

#### For Example:&#x20;

Here we look at the referral link of an affiliate.

![Affiliate Profile](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2020-02-26 042049.png>)

In the Referral Link, the referral code can be found at the end (after the "=" symbol).&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2020-02-26 042502.png>)

Here the referral link is: **https://goaffpro.myshopify.com/?ref=R8mfScYiL**&#x20;

The referral code in the link is: **R8mfScYiL**
