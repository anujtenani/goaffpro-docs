# Tracking Modes

**Tracking Modes** are used to track sales made by customers using the affiliate's referral link or code.&#x20;

#### There are two types of tracking modes available:

* Referral Link
* Coupon Code

#### Referral Link

Referral links are used by customers to visit the store. These links are generated for affiliates automatically and are unique to each affiliate. When an affiliate's referral link is used by a customer to visit the store and make a purchase, that will get recorded by the app and attributed to the affiliate.

#### Coupon Code

Coupon codes are also used to track customer sales. These can be generated for affiliates automatically, using the automatic coupons option (in the Coupons tab). When an affiliate's coupon code is used to make a purchase, the sale will get recorded by the app and attributed to the affiliate.
