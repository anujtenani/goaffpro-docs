**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to enable additional dashboard tabs for affiliates.

To enable additional dashboard tabs for affiliates, go to the **Affiliate dashboard** section in the **Look and Feel** tab of the GoAffPro admin panel.

By default, an affiliate's dashboard has four tabs: Home, Marketing Tools, Payments, and Settings.

Here in the **Dashboard Tabs** section, you have the option to enable additional tabs and sections within them.

For example, here we enable the Advanced Analytics tab by checking the box.

After this, the Analytics tab will appear in the affiliate's dashboard.
