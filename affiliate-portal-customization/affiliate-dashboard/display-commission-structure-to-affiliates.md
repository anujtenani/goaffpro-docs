# Display Commission Structure to Affiliates

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to display the commission structure to affiliates.

{% hint style="info" %}
The production commissions table widget displays the current commission structure for affiliates in their dashboard. This keeps the affiliates informed of any changes to program commissions.
{% endhint %}

To display the commission structure to affiliates, go to the **Affiliate Dashboard** section of the Look and Feel tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.
