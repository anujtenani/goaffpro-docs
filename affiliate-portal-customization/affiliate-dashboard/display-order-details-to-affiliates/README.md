# Display Order Details to Affiliates

**GoAffPro** provides you with the option to display the order details to affiliates.

{% hint style="info" %}
The order details widget presents affiliates with a table containing referral order information such as order date and time, order number, order amount, and commission. It provides affiliates with a clearer view of their referral sales.
{% endhint %}

To display the order details to affiliates, go to the **Affiliate Dashboard** section of the Look and Feel tab in the GoAffPro admin panel.
